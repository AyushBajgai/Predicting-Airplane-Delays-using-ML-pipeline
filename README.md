# Flight Delays ML Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains all Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used to analyze airline flight delays.  
The workflow covers:
- Data loading and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  

You can access the dataset from this source:
